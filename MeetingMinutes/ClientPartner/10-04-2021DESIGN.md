## Topics Discussed

We asked Josh to record himself annotating a game using the current setup so we could get a sense of the button pattern to see if it could be improved/more efficient

Discussed a Offense/Defense option for annotation page that would hide some buttons so the UI wouldn't look so cluttered and it would be easier to fill out for the analysts

Discussed first iteration features and what pages we thought would be good to start working on

Discussed the tech stack with Bryce and some errors/hurdles to expect from React and Firebase
