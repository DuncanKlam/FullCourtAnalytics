## Topics Discussed

We discussed the basics of the website that has been created, and what Josh wanted to see in an evolved version.

We learned we would be focusing most on the tagging features for the folks at Full Court, and the individual player pages. While the coach side of the site could use a little updating it is not our primary focus, as there is already a fairly well designed implementation. There is already a well thought out Figma for the site, so design will be largely based off of individual tweaks we think would look better and not so much the grand design of the whole site. This site that Bryce made has sped up Josh's post-game processing time to 1-1.5 hours down from 4 hours, and a goal of ours is to shave as many minutes off of that as possible, since it is already fairly streamlined.  

We will be using React.JS, Javascript, and Firebase as our tech stack.
