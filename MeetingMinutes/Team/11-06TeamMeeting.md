## Topics Discussed

Redoing the account settings page to make it cleaner, and more readable.

Creating a submit button for account settings page, and being able to save the information submitted in the text boxes.

Making the buttons of the annotation page functional so when they are clicked and it shows it on the stat line at the bottom.

Added a select player menu for the annotation page

## Things Clarified

Once we have a submit button for the account settings page, we can then work on the player profile because it relies on the account settings page.

Picking a player for the devs to annotate their game, and having the buttons be functional.
