# Favorite Bending Skill
# Duncan
I've always wanted to fly, and being able to usea glider and control the air currents to fly infinitely would be dope

# Kyler
Fire, because of all of the pros of fire. Instant hot food, campfires, and a light source sound really good.

# Curtis
All of them because being the all powerful avatar would be amazing. Firstly air though,  because flying would be awesome.

# Erik
Water, because it's the most helpful bending skill. The ability to bring a live-giving resource to people is fantastic.

# What would happen if we really had benders
The world would definitely be a lot more chaotic. We think that initially people may band together to form a symbiotic realtionship with different benders to help each other out. However we also know people are very greedy and there would probably be more powerful benders who team up to take over everyone else.


# What bending skill would be most helpful for software engineering
Water, a naturally calm disposition would favor a software engineer in both professional meetings, and when code isn't working properly, or if a project falls behind schedule and crunch time needs to happen.
