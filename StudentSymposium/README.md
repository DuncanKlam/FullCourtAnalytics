# Team Member Experiences

## Eric Vester
The Student Symposium was a very unique experience. It was a good time to see what others around Ball State was doing. 
It was nice to see that some people are actually interested in what we do. It was also a good time getting to know my team members more. 
The only thing I did not like about it was standing the whole time even though there was chairs. 
Mostly because when I did try to sit down it was at the wrong time and someone came to see the poster.

## Kyler Hudson
I had a good experience at the Student Symposium. Being able to show off our website to faculty and other students was fun.
Many of the people that stopped by to learn about our website seemed very interested in what it had to offer, including the work put into it.
Being able to walk around Worthen arena and look at all the other projects, research papers, and experiemnets in other majors was a cool experience.
Overall, I enjoyed the experience and time put into making it happen, the only downfal I had with the Student Symposium was the award ceremony went 
on for a long time.

## Duncan Klemm
My experience at the symposium wasn’t particularly exciting, but it was nice to see what people thought of our project. 
Talking to the judges gave me an idea of how people who were being exposed to it for the first time and who hadn’t been staring at 
error messages trying to get to this result perceived the end product. It was nice to hear compliments about the styling, and 
even nicer to hear what people thought our next steps would be. As well, there were some interesting posters and some smart people to talk to.
